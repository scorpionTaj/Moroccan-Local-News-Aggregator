Israeli product boycott regains momentum with Pizza Hut at the forefront,Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 14:11,international,"Many businesses, including McDonald’s, Zara, and Carrefour, are being boycotted in light of the Gaza-Israel conflict for their steadfast support of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Pizza Hut has now joined this list.
On X, previously known as Twitter, many voiced their call to boycott the fast food brand, as several pictures show IDF soldiers holding Pizza Hut boxes and showing gratitude to the brand for providing free meals to their military bases. AdChoicesADVERTISING

Lebanese Journalist Ghadi Francis, after sharing pictures of the IDF soldiers posing with the boxes, wrote on X, “Did the genocide lover franchise close all its stores in Lebanon yet?
What are we waiting for? @pizzahut.”
Dr. Anastasia Maria Loupis shared a screenshot from an Instagram story by Pizza Hut Israel showing the soldiers happily grabbing dozens of pizza boxes and writing on the same platform, “Should we do Pizza Hut next?” (referring to boycotting the franchise.)
Several statements hint that the food franchise is providing free meals to Israeli soldiers in light of the innocent killing of thousands of civilians in Gaza.
As the hashtag #boycottpizzahut went viral, many Israeli social media users shared content featuring their Pizza Hut orders.

It’s literally so easy to boycott those fast food corps who give their money to Israel
You can cook better food for urself,,,andddd it’s healthier!!!
The food at McDonald’s, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, etc is so greasy, packed w calories, and EXPENSIVE.
You deserve better.

The coffee brand Starbucks and the fast food giant McDonald’s have suffered great losses in light of the growing boycott, which is why many wonder why Pizza Hut didn’t learn from these previous examples.
Nevertheless, several McDonald’s and Starbucks branches voiced their complete disconnect from the bigger companies that help fund the IDF.
For instance, McDonald’s Malaysia has sued a pro-Palestinian group for $1.3 million over its calls to boycott companies allegedly supporting Israel.
The same McDonald’s said it “does not support nor condone the current conflict in the Middle East.” According to a copy of the legal document seen by AFP, it has sought six million ringgit in damages for alleged defamation.

"EU presses Israel on two-state solution after war in Gaza Brussels, Belgium",Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 14:11,international,"The EU’s foreign policy chief on Monday insisted on an eventual two-state solution as he told Israel it couldn’t build peace “only by military means” ahead of talks with Israeli and Palestinian top diplomats.
Josep Borrell repeated the condemnation from the United Nations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “unacceptable” rejection of calls for a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza.
“What we want to do is to build a two-state solution. So let’s talk about it,” Borrell said.




He told Israel that “peace and stability cannot be built only by military means”.
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill off them?” Borrell said.
The surprise Hamas attack on October 7 on Israel and the subsequent devastating military response from Israel has plunged the Middle East into fresh turmoil and sparked fears of a broader conflict.
But while the bloodshed appears to have driven a long-term solution further out of sight, EU officials insist now is the time to talk about finally resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The 27 EU ministers will first meet with Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz, before sitting down separately with the Palestinian Authority’s top diplomat Riyad al-Maliki.
Katz and Maliki are not expected to meet each other.
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia will also hold talks with the European ministers.
The top EU diplomat said he had presented ministers from the bloc with a “comprehensive approach” towards trying to find a lasting peace including an international conference.
Borrell risked incurring Israel’s wrath by accusing it on Friday of having “created” and “financed” Hamas to undermine the prospect for a possible Palestinian state.
Borrell insisted the only way to get an enduring peace in the region was for a two-state solution to “be imposed from outside”.
The EU has struggled for a united stance on the conflict in Gaza as staunch backers of Israel such as Germany have rejected demands for an immediate ceasefire made by the likes of Spain and Ireland.
“The reports we are receiving, even as late as last evening, are dire in respect to what’s happening within Gaza,” said Ireland’s foreign minister Micheal Martin.
– ‘Imposed from outside’ –
EU officials have sketched out broad conditions for “the day after” the current war ends in Gaza, calling for no long-term Israeli occupation, an end to Hamas rule and a role for the Palestinian Authority in running the territory.
Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip, launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, resulting in the death of about 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages during the attacks, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
Israel has vowed to “annihilate” Hamas in response and its relentless air and ground offensive has killed at least 25,105 people, mostly women and children, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.",https://en.hespress.com/78485-eu-presses-israel-on-two-state-solution-after-war-in-gaza-brussels-belgium.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Borrell.jpeg
12 dead in Israeli strike on Damascus: monitor,Thursday 28 December 2023 - 23:53,international,"A strike targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ Syria spy chief in Damascus and blamed on Israel killed 12 people, a war monitor said Sunday in an updated toll.
“The death toll has risen to 12… five Iranians, including three IRGC leaders, four Syrians working with the Iranians, two Lebanese, and one Iraqi national,” said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights of Saturday’s strike.
The British-based monitor with a network of sources inside Syria previously reported 10 deaths.




The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) confirmed it lost five members in the strike it blamed on Israel, its regional arch-foe.
Quoting an informed source, Iran’s Mehr news agency said “the Revolutionary Guards’ Syria intel chief” and his deputy were among those “martyred in the attack on Syria by Israel”.
The monitor said the building targeted belonged to the IRGC and that the neighbourhood is known to be a high-security zone home to leaders of the IRGC and pro-Iran Palestinian factions.
The Mazzeh area is also home to a United Nations headquarters, embassies and restaurants.
Saturday’s presumed Israeli strike was the second high-profile targeted assassination in Syria in less than a month.
In December, an air strike also blamed on Israel killed a senior Iranian general in Syria.
Razi Moussavi was the most senior commander of the Quds Force to be killed outside Iran since a January 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad killed IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani.
During more than a decade of civil war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces as well as Syrian army positions.
But such attacks have intensified since the war between Israel and Hamas, which like Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement is an ally of Iran, began on October 7.
Israel rarely comments on individual strikes targeting Syria but has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran, which backs President Bashar al-Assad’s government, to expand its presence there.

"Health ministry in Gaza says war death toll at 25,105",Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 14:11,international,"The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday at least 25,105 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the war with Israel broke out on October 7.
A ministry statement said some 62,681 people were also wounded in the fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants.
Over the past 24 hours, the ministry said 178 people had been killed across the Gaza Strip.




“Dozens are still under the rubble,” the Hamas government media office said in a separate statement.

Sudan suspends membership in IGAD east Africa bloc,Saturday 20 January 2024 - 14:27,international,"The government of war-torn Sudan has informed IGAD it is suspending its membership in the east Africa bloc, the foreign ministry loyal to army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said Saturday.
Khartoum had already announced on Tuesday that it was freezing relations with IGAD for inviting paramilitary chief Mohamed Hamdan Daglo — at war with Burhan for nine months — to a summit in Uganda that discussed the Sudan conflict.
Sudan “is facing one of the fastest unfolding crises globally”, the United Nations humanitarian agency, OCHA, says, with more than 7.4 million people displaced and more than half the population needing humanitarian assistance.




The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, an analyst group, puts the death toll at more than 13,000.
In a statement, Sudan’s foreign ministry said Burhan sent a letter on Saturday to President Ismail Omar Guelleho of Djibouti, current chair of the bloc, “to inform him of the Sudanese government decision suspending its membership in this organisation”.
At its summit on Thursday, IGAD reiterated its call for “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” in the “unjust war affecting the people” of Sudan.
The bloc also expressed “continued readiness to offer its good offices to facilitate an all-inclusive peace process”, and again called for a face-to-face meeting between the two sides.
A final communique from the extraordinary assembly gave the generals two weeks to meet.
Sudan’s foreign ministry said it was this item, placed on the agenda without Sudan’s approval, which led it to the further step of suspending its membership.
The ministry also accused the summit communique of violating Sudan’s sovereignty and “wounding the sentiments of victims of rebel militia atrocities”, a reference to Daglo’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF).
Both sides have been accused of war crimes, including the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, torture and arbitrary detention of civilians.
The RSF has also been accused of ethnically motivated mass killings, rampant looting and rapes.
IGAD, in parallel with the United States and Saudi Arabia, has repeatedly attempted to mediate between the two warring generals, but to no avail.
Daglo toured several African capitals from late December in his first foreign trip since the start of the war last April. It is part of a strategy analysts see as a bid for international legitimacy and is likely linked to the United Arab Emirates.
In Addis Ababa, Daglo signed a declaration with Sudan’s former civilian prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, who also attended the IGAD summit.
The RSF appears to have been gaining new ground in recent months, with little resistance from the army.",https://en.hespress.com/78428-sudan-suspends-membership-in-igad-east-africa-bloc.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/sudan-guerre-4.jpg
Africa in debt spiral as restructuring efforts drag on,Saturday 20 January 2024 - 20:25,international,"While the explosion of debt is throwing a shadow over global economic growth, experts warn that sub-Saharan Africa, where several countries are already in default, is experiencing its worst-ever crisis.
The rise in interest rates and over-indebtedness is already crimping the ability of countries to finance their development, as a number of African leaders emphasised at appearances at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
– The origins of the crisis –
Following the 2007-2009 global economic crisis central banks in industrialised countries have generally kept interest rates low and countries from the Global South, which had mostly been  borrowing bilaterally or from international financial institutions, gained unprecedented access to financial markets.




“Many developing countries in a desperate need for cash injection in their economies rushed to these low-cost loans, in markets with no rules or regulation,” said Kenyan economist Attiya Waris, who also serves as an independent expert for the United Nations.
She added that the International Monetary Fund had encouraged them to do so.
The money helped provide a much-needed boost to many African economies, but countries dependent upon the export of raw materials such as oil, minerals and wood came under intense pressure when commodity prices began falling in 2015.
The Covid pandemic further aggravated the situation.
The fall in commodity prices squeezed the foreign currency revenues they needed to service their loans.
Several countries took out new loans to repay their existing debt, creating a debt spiral that is preventing investment in vital infrastructure, health systems and education.
The World Bank last year estimated that 22 countries are a heightened risk of over-indebtedness, including Ghana and Zambia, which has defaulted on its foreign debt.
Also on the list were Malawi and Chad, which has an IMF assistance programme.
Ethiopia, which Fitch Ratings put on partial default in December, is also negotiating a rescue package.
– Private lenders blocking deals –
In 2022, African public debt stood at $1.8 trillion, a 183 percent jump from 2010, having grown at around four times as fast as economic output, according to UN figures.
Gathering under the aegis of the G20, Western public creditors and several partners including China — which has often been accused of laying debt traps with easy loans for infrastructure projects — have been trying to work out a debt restructuring for 40 African countries.
These debt deals are built on the principal of equal treatment — all the creditors must participate.
But the deals for African nations have been tough to conclude as private lenders are often baulking at the terms.
Private investors — including investment funds and pension funds — have in recent years risen to become the top lender to African nations.
In 2022, they held 42 percent of African foreign public debt, compared to 38 percent for multilateral institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, and 20 percent was held by other nations.
Of the 20 percent held by other nations, China was the biggest lender to Africa, alone holding 11 percent.
“China is often presented as the ‘big bad guy’, but it has understood the importance of giving a bit of air to states in deep trouble and is now participating in the efforts, even if this is taking some time,” said Mathieu Paris, coordinator of the French Platform for Debt and Development, which brings together more than two dozen civic groups to push for sustainable debt restructuring.
The case of Zambia is instructive. After two years of tough negotiations, the country in June 2023 reached what was presented as an “historic” debt restructuring deal.
But it only concerned $6.3 billion of its $18.6 billion foreign debt. Worse, it only would go into effect if private lenders agreed to take a similar hit, and the US asset manager BlackRock — one of the major private holders of Zambian debt — baulked.
“BlackRock blocked the whole negotiations” for Zambia, said the economist Waris.
– Inflation and poverty –
With higher interest rates adding more pain to the already crushing debt, “African countries are experiencing dangerous currency fluctuations and inflation is increasing all the time,” said Ghanaian economist Charles Abugre.
“The daily impact is dramatic for poor people: we’re seeing an explosion in the cost of transport, food, housing, while real wages have stagnated,” he added.
For Amine Idriss Adoum, a senior director at the African Union Development Agency, “the real question today isn’t to know how to get out from under the debt, but how to borrow intelligently”.
While restructuring the debt is important, it “shouldn’t be done at the detriment of investments in infrastructure, health and energy” to support the development of economies and societies.",https://en.hespress.com/78415-africa-in-debt-spiral-as-restructuring-efforts-drag-on.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dollars-800.webp
80% of French citizens unbothered by senior officials' sexual orientation,Wednesday 17 January 2024 - 20:49,international,"In the recent ballet of ministerial portfolio redistribution in France, which followed Emmanuel Macron’s appointment of Gabriel Attal as Prime Minister with the task of forming a new government, the latter’s sexual orientation was the subject of heated debate.
This debate was amplified by the subsequent appointment of her former partner, Stéphane Séjourné, as Minister of Foreign Affairs. It raised questions about the “normalization” of homosexuality within the French government and high-level positions.
According to a recent survey by French opinion and marketing research institute IFOP, 80% of French citizens believe that the election of a person from the LGBTQ+ community to the presidency of the Republic is not shocking to them. Only 20% expressed the opposite opinion.




The results of this survey also reveal a positive evolution in the level of tolerance of French citizens towards the access of LGBTQ+ people to high-level positions, including the presidency. Indeed, the percentage of French people accepting this idea has risen from 30% in 1981 to 46% in 1997, then to 73% in 2002, and is currently at 80%. At the same time, the percentage of those who consider it “shocking” has fallen from 61% in 1981 to 20%.
In addition, 65% of French people said they “have no problem” voting for a candidate who openly displays his or her sexual orientation in the forthcoming presidential elections, while 12% expressed the opposite, considering this to be an “obstacle” in their voting intentions.
In the same context, in response to a question about their opinion on the presence of politicians declaring their sexual orientation in government, 26% of French people expressed their support, representing a nine-point increase on the last survey carried out in 2003. On the other hand, 13% are opposed to the appointment of LGBTQ+ people to government positions. Furthermore, 61% of those surveyed indicated that they are not interested in the sexual orientations of government members.
IFOP also revealed that 25% of French citizens support the public declaration of politicians’ sexual orientation, while 17% are opposed. Some 58% of those questioned said they didn’t think it was important.
Gabriel Attal, current Prime Minister, tops the list of French political figures considered most open, with 55% of citizens supporting his efforts to promote the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. He is followed by President Emmanuel Macron, whom half of citizens consider to be “open to recognizing and promoting the rights of LGBTQ+ people in France”. Respondents also believe that far-right politicians are the most opposed to such openness.
French President Emmanuel Macron recently appointed Gabriel Attal, former Minister of Education, to head the government, making him the youngest politician to hold a ministerial post and the first Prime Minister to publicly declare his sexual orientation.",https://en.hespress.com/78366-80-of-french-citizens-unbothered-by-senior-officials-sexual-orientation.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gabriel-Attal-macron.webp
Biden says Palestinian state still possible after Netanyahu call,Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 14:11,international,"US President Joe Biden said Friday it was still possible Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could agree to some form of Palestinian state, after the two leaders spoke for the first time in nearly a month amid tensions over the Gaza war.
Their call came a day after Netanyahu said he opposes allowing Palestinian sovereignty in the wake of the conflict with Hamas, deepening Israeli divisions with key backer Washington over the conduct of Israel’s offensive and what comes next.
But Biden said after the call that it was not impossible Netanyahu might come round to some form of so-called two-state solution, mooted for decades as a way to end tensions in the Middle East, despite the Israeli premier’s comments.




“There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There’s a number of countries that are members of the UN that… don’t have their own militaries,” Biden told reporters after an event at the White House.
“And so, I think there’s ways in which this could work.”
Asked what Netanyahu was open to, Biden replied: “I’ll let you know.”
Biden and Netanyahu, who have a complicated relationship stretching back some 40 years, last spoke on December 23 and the silence between them since has led to repeated questions about a rift.
Netanyahu has pledged to destroy Hamas and demilitarize Gaza following the October 7 attacks on Israel, and is increasingly resistant to US pressure for a plan that includes any form of Palestinian statehood that could threaten his country.
The Israeli premier said on Thursday that his country “must have security control over all the territory west of the Jordan (River)” and that he had made this clear to Israel’s “American friends”.
“This is a necessary condition, and it conflicts with the idea of (Palestinian) sovereignty,” Netanyahu said in public remarks.
– ‘Promise and possibility’ –
The White House said earlier that Biden had pushed the issue with Netanyahu when they spoke, but said the call had not been in direct response to the Israeli’s comments.
“The president still believes in the promise and the possibility of a two-state solution” for both Israelis and Palestinians, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
The call also discussed US hostages still among those held captive by Hamas since the October 7 attack on Israel, he added.
Biden and Netanyahu have often been at loggerheads in the past, with the Democratic US president last year pressing the right-wing Israeli premier over controversial judicial reforms.
But Biden has stood firmly behind Israel since October 7, even travelling to the country after the attacks, where he publicly embraced Netanyahu and pledged full US support.
Fresh tensions have emerged since then however as the toll of the Israeli offensive on Gaza has mounted, with Biden warning that Israel could lose support by “indiscriminate bombing” and pushing for a two-state solution.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week said Israel would not get “genuine security” without a “pathway to a Palestinian state.”
The October 7 attacks resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures. Militants also seized about 250 hostages, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza.
Israel’s relentless air and ground offensive has killed at least 24,762 Palestinians, around 70 percent of them women, young children and adolescents, according to Gaza’s health ministry.",https://en.hespress.com/78405-biden-says-palestinian-state-still-possible-after-netanyahu-call.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/palestine-allemagne.jpg
Global tourism to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2024: UN tourism agency,Saturday 20 January 2024 - 23:06,international,"International tourism levels will be slightly higher than its pre-pandemic levels in 2024 boosted by an expected resurgence in Asia, the UN’s World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) said Friday.
“International tourism is expected to fully recover pre-pandemic levels in 2024, with initial estimates pointing to 2.0 percent growth above 2019 levels,” the Madrid-based agency said in a statement.
Figures for last year showed that 1.3 billion tourists travelled abroad, 44 percent higher than in 2022 and 88 percent of the numbers in 2019.




UNTWO pointed to “a stronger recovery of Asian markets” but noted that the biggest rise was in the Middle East which was “the only region to overcome pre-pandemic levels with arrivals 22 percent above 2019”.
Europe, the world’s most visited region, also saw a strong performance with tourism reaching 94 percent of its 2019 figures, with African figures reaching 96 percent.
In relative terms, the Asia-Pacific region was the weakest with just 65 percent of pre-pandemic levels, despite China’s lifting of health restrictions a year ago after a strict three-year zero-Covid strategy when it cut itself off from the world.
“The latest UNWTO data underscores tourism’s resilience and rapid recovery, with pre-pandemic numbers expected by the end of 2024,” its Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said in the statement.
Chinese tourism was expected to gather pace this year with Beijing offering visa-free travel for citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia until the end of November.
The prediction for 2024, however, “remains subject to the pace of recovery in Asia and to the evolution of existing economic and geopolitical downside risks,” it said, notably due to the Israel-Hamas war and the unsettled global economy.
“Persisting inflation, high interest rates, volatile oil prices and disruptions to trade can continue to impact transport and accommodations costs in 2024,” it warned.",https://en.hespress.com/78358-global-tourism-to-reach-pre-pandemic-levels-in-2024-un-tourism-agency.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ouarzazate-tourism.jpg
Spain: Supreme Court rules deportations of hundreds of Minors to Morocco in 2021 as illegal,Tuesday 31 January 2023 - 23:53,international,"Spain’s Supreme Court ruled Monday that the authorities acted illegally when they forcibly deported approximately 1,500 unaccompanied minor migrants to Morocco following a mass border crossing into Ceuta that happened in May 2021.
Despite acknowledging the “extraordinary challenge” encountered by Spain and the local government in Ceuta, the court concluded that the Spanish authorities completely disregarded the requirements of Spanish migration law and European human rights law.AdChoicesADVERTISING
The Spanish Interior Ministry defended the repatriation of unaccompanied children over the border, claiming that they displayed a voluntary desire to return home. Spanish officials dismissed accusations that the returns breached international law.




The Supreme Court ruled the Spanish authorities’ actions were illegal due to the lack of individual administrative procedures, hearings for minor migrants, and other legal resources.
The court also confirmed that the authorities breached minors’ rights by failing to examine their interests or circumstances before repatriating them, which could expose them to serious physical or psychological injury.
It also emphasized that the collective expulsion of migrants, which occurred in this case, violated Article 4 of Protocol No.4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, of which Spain is a signatory.
Spain’s leftist government contended in court that a 2007 bilateral agreement between Spain and Morocco allowed for the return of the minors, mentioning the “exceptional circumstances of the mass border crossing in May 2021. This argument was ultimately rejected by the Spanish Court.
For context, around 12,000 migrants, including hundreds of unaccompanied minors, tried to cross into the occupied city of Ceuta, by scaling a border fence or swimming around it in a period of two days. The incident happened amid a diplomatic rift between Rabat and Madrid.
Three months after the large influx of migrants, Spanish authorities initiated the repatriation of approximately 1,500 minors to Morocco in August.
Many of the individuals who crossed the border in 2021 were thought to be Sub-Saharan migrants seeking a better life in Europe.
Each year, thousands of Sub-Saharan African migrants undertake their journey to Spain from Morocco.
