"Morocco-DRC: FRMF addresses match incident, emphasizes ties between two countries",Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 15:35,sports,"The Royal Moroccan Football Federation has broken its silence regarding the brawl that erupted after the Atlas Lions match against the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday, in the second round of the Africa Cup of Nations group stage.
The FRMF clarified the incident through an official statement, highlighting the exceptional and historical relations between Morocco and the DRC and emphasizing the fraternal ties between the two nations.

Mohammed VI Football Academy has become 'Global Benchmark' Jeune Afrique,Thursday 18 January 2024 - 15:47,sports,"With its six pitches and top-class facilities, the Mohammed VI Football Academy (AMF) has become a “world reference,” writes Jeune Afrique magazine on Monday.
Located in Sala Al Jadida, near Rabat, on an 18-hectare site, the AMF is training the nuggets of tomorrow, underlines the pan-African media outlet in an article posted online under the title “the Mohammed VI Football Academy, factory of champions”.
“Inaugurated by the Sovereign on March 31, 2010, the institution’s first objective was to promote training made in Morocco, and this has now been achieved,” notes the publication.




Before 2010, training was average, which had an impact on the level of the national team”, recalls Tarik Elkhazri, technical manager at the AMF, quoted by Jeune Afrique.
Recalling that four “academists” reached the semi-finals of the Qatar 2022 World Cup with the national team, the publication explains that the latest feat was the 2023 U17 World Cup in Indonesia, where the Atlas Cubs reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their history.
“A global benchmark and source of inspiration for several African and European federations, the AMF model is based on a dual objective: sporting and academic,” Elkhazri points out.",https://en.hespress.com/78518-mohammed-vi-football-academy-has-become-global-benchmark-jeune-afrique.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1644533183-10556_1.jpg
Who is to blame in Regragui’s quarrel with Mbemba?,Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 15:35,sports,"The altercation that marked Morocco’s second game in AFCON with DR Congo started with a handshake between Morocco’s coach Walid Regragui, and DRC captain Chancel Mbemba. Inappropriate exchanges of words and physical altercations escalated to what almost resulted in a serious incident. The incident has now made worldwide headlines.
According to Regragui, Mbemba verbally attacked him and his assistant on the sidelines before the match concluded, he said in an interview with French newspaper L’Equipe.
Regragui explained that despite the confrontation, he extended a handshake to Mbemba, questioning why he was being treated poorly. Mbemba then looked somewhere else as if to say to him, “I will not shake your hand,” which made Regraoui grab him by the hand as shown in the pictures.




Regragui claimed that Mbemba, instead of reciprocating the gesture, avoided the handshake and insulted him with racist remarks, leading to a physical altercation captured in pictures.
“I never uttered any racist words against him. He talks about religion, so let him be honest with himself,” Regragui said, responding to Mbemba’s post-match statements.
Mbemba refused to comment on the matter, saying that “God was a witness to the truth about the incident”. In a press conference, Walid Regragui tried to control the situation. “I have nothing to say about it. I have a lot of respect for Mbemba,” he explained.
Regragui expressed dissatisfaction, urging Mbemba to produce additional pictures to provide a more accurate account of the incident.
 “Perhaps it’s the adrenaline that pushed him to react like that. There is no problem. I regret it because we did not portray a good image, neither us nor the DRC,” the national coach said.
X users are now accusing Walid Regragui of racism, claiming that the coach provoked Mbemba at the end of the game. 
“By speaking in the way that he did, he is implying that my comments are racist; it is dishonest. Since he only talks about religion in his speech, he should be a little honest with himself,” said Regraugui to Le Figaro. 
After these statements, Mbemba’s Instagram account was targeted by many Moroccan users who replied to his latest posts with monkey or gorilla emojis or wrote racist comments.
These comments stirred the controversy even further, causing many to sympathize with the DRC coach as they denounced Moroccans for their racism.
Several African users on X discussed how Moroccans believe they are better than other African nations. Being considered a targeted attack on the coach of DR Congo, the topic is currently being covered by several media outlets from this angle. Furthermore, Regragui is being blamed for the entire incident in other tweets that demonstrate videos of the fights.
In the same vein, the Moroccan player and captain of the national team, Romain Saiss, addressed the controversy in a lengthy Instagram story.
“Football is a sport. With tension, adrenaline, and much more. What’s certain is that what happens off the field stays on the field. We all make mistakes given the pressure and challenges,” said the player.
“We should stay united; we are all proud of representing Africa; we shouldn’t be divided over nonesense; and let’s show the brotherhood that unites our continent,” he concluded.",https://en.hespress.com/78511-who-is-to-blame-in-regraguis-quarrel-with-mbemba.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mbemba-vs-Regragui.webp
Injured Salah convinced AFCON success will come 'sooner or later',Sunday 21 January 2024 - 20:26,sports,"Mohamed Salah said Sunday he is convinced he will win the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt “sooner or later” but admitted his country will need to improve if they are to do so at this year’s edition, where he is currently out injured.
The Liverpool forward spoke to reporters ahead of the Pharaohs’ decisive final group game against Cape Verde on Monday, which Egypt need to win to be sure of qualifying for the last 16.
But they will be without Salah for the game in Abidjan, as he recovers from the hamstring injury which forced him off in the first half of the team’s 2-2 draw with Ghana on Thursday.




“I would love to win it, absolutely,” Salah said when asked what it would mean to win the AFCON to add to the medals he has picked up at club level with Liverpool.
“I have won everything possible but this one not yet.
“It will happen somehow, that is what I believe, and whatever I believe I achieve, so sooner or later it will happen.”
Salah made his Egypt debut in 2011, a year after they won the last of their record seven Cup of Nations titles.
He played in the teams that lost the finals in Gabon in 2017, and at the last edition in Cameroon two years ago, and is now determined to go one step further this time.
“Everybody knows what it means to any player to win an Africa Cup,” the 31-year-old said.
“We were unlucky at the last one and also in Gabon. The players are very motivated to win the tournament. We all want to win it.”
However, Rui Vitoria’s team have not convinced so far in Ivory Coast, needing Salah’s injury-time penalty to draw 2-2 with Mozambique in their first match, and then having to come from behind twice to hold Ghana after Salah went off.
If they beat Cape Verde — who have already secured first place in Group B — Egypt will advance to a last-16 tie in San-Pedro on January 28.
Salah has already been ruled out of that game too, and is only expected to return for a quarter-final on February 2 or 3, should Egypt make it that far.
“At the end of the day we are not doing great at the moment but we have a fantastic team and a great coach, so we just need to stay focused,” Salah said.
“I believe that with hard work everything is possible, so we just need to win one game to qualify and we go from there.”
Of his own fitness, he added: “My injury is still there but the most important thing now is to speak about the game.
“We are very positive, we have great players and a great team, and we just need to fight and see what will happen.”
Salah’s place in the starting line-up could be taken by Mostafa Fathi of Cairo club Pyramids, who came on for him against Ghana.",https://en.hespress.com/78461-injured-salah-convinced-afcon-success-will-come-sooner-or-later.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mohamed-salah-Carlos-Queiroz.jpg
Mohammed VI Academy Is 'important lever' for football development in Morocco,Sunday 21 January 2024 - 22:28,sports,"The Mohammed VI Academy is “an important lever” for the outstanding rise of Moroccan football, which performed brilliantly at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, says Senegalese sports journalist Ibrahima Diop.
Morocco’s sports policy, under the leadership of King Mohammed VI, and the investments made to strengthen sports infrastructure and training, notably the Mohammed VI Football Academy, “were quick to bear fruit,” stressed Diop, who is publication director of the magazine “l’Equipe Type”, in a statement to MAP news agency.
Since the launch of the Mohammed VI Academy in 2009, Morocco has begun to reap the rewards of its far-sighted strategy, added Diop, highlighting the national team’s fine performance at the 2022 World Cup and at the start of the 34th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations currently being held in Côte d’Ivoire.

Bounedjah salvages draw for Algeria against Burkina Faso at AFCON,Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 15:18,sports,"Baghdad Bounedjah headed home five minutes into injury time to earn Algeria a 2-2 draw with Burkina Faso at the Africa Cup of Nations on Saturday, forcing their opponents to wait to secure a place in the last 16.
Mohamed Konate’s opening goal for Burkina Faso was cancelled out by a first Bounedjah equaliser, but a Bertrand Traore penalty put the Stallions back in front to the delight of their many supporters in the crowd of over 33,000 in Bouake, Ivory Coast’s second city.
At that point Burkina Faso were heading through, but Bounedjah equalised a second time at the death to take his overall tally of goals to three and join Emilio Nsue of Equatorial Guinea as the tournament’s joint-top scorer.




Burkina Faso, the 2013 Cup of Nations runners-up who reached the semi-finals at the last edition in Cameroon two years ago, have four points from two games in Group D and remain on course to qualify for the knockout phase before facing Angola next.
Algeria, who were held 1-1 by Angola in their opening game, have two points and a win against Mauritania on Tuesday will suffice for them to advance.
They needed Bounedjah’s late goal, however, to stave off the spectre of a repeat of two years ago, when Djamel Belmadi’s team went to Cameroon as reigning African champions but were knocked out in the group stage with just one point and one goal scored.
Nevertheless, Riyad Mahrez and his teammates clearly struggled in the sapping mid-afternoon heat and will welcome having an evening kick-off in their final group outing.
Burkina Faso, whose French coach Hubert Velud has previously worked at several Algerian clubs, went ahead three minutes into stoppage time at the end of the first half.
Russian-based striker Konate, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, threw himself at a terrific ball into the box from deep on the left flank and headed home. The goal was given after a VAR check confirmed he was onside.
Algeria drew level six minutes after the restart as Bounedjah turned the ball in from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
Yet Burkina Faso were awarded a penalty midway through the second half after a VAR review showed that Rayan Ait-Nouri had kicked the shin of Issa Kabore in the box when trying to make a clearance.
On as a substitute, Aston Villa forward Traore converted the penalty, just as he had done to give Burkina Faso a 1-0 win over Mauritania in their first match.
Algeria responded by withdrawing wingers Mahrez and Youcef Belaili, before being rescued by Bounedjah’s 95th-minute header.",https://en.hespress.com/78430-bounedjah-salvages-draw-for-algeria-against-burkina-faso-at-afcon.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GESzxAXWsAA61rO.jpg
"Regragui addresses Gabon strategy, weather challenges ahead of AFCON game",Tuesday 23 January 2024 - 15:35,sports,"Atlas Lions coach Walid Regragui explained the reason behind his intervention to address the controversy surrounding Azzedine Ounahi’s celebration after scoring a goal in the match against Tanzania, especially since some fans believed was aimed at the Egyptian team.
“Ounahi did not intend through his celebration against Tanzania what has been circulated. He is a player with high morals” defended Regragui today during the press conference preceding the Morocco-Congo match at the African Cup of Nations (AFCON).
Regragui emphasized that he would make sure that nothing would distract his team’s focus.
“Ounahi remains a crucial player, and we didn’t want him to be distracted by any controversy, even though there were any,” continued the coach.




In response to a question from Hesport about Noussair Mazraoui’s readiness, the Atlas Lions coach replied, “Mazraoui is very likely to be present in the third match,” adding that “a minor cold is the only thing delaying his preparation.”
Speaking about the Democratic Republic of Congo match, Regragui commented, “We will face a good team, with players of excellent experience who play in the biggest international clubs. This match will not be easy for us.”
He stressed that “we must forget the victory in the first match and focus on tomorrow’s game. We must respect the opponent to achieve the most important thing, which is to advance to the second round of the AFCON.”
“The weather conditions here in Ivory Coast are indeed challenging, even the timing of the match, but we must adapt to the situation and leave excuses aside,” underscored the coach of the Moroccan national team.
Responding to a question from a Congolese journalist, Regragui emphasized that “you always have to be cautious of the leopard, because if you don’t watch out, it will devour you and our strategy is to not let it devour us.
The upcoming match tomorrow, said the Atlas Lions coach, will be a new challenge for both Congo and Morocco, stressing that both teams have evolved and are not the same as they were two or three years ago.",https://en.hespress.com/78425-regragui-addresses-gabon-strategy-weather-challenges-ahead-of-afcon-game.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regragui-can-cp.webp

Amrouche had provoked Morocco with statements in which he claimed that the Royal Football League controlled the corridors of African football, by choosing the dates and referees of the matches.




For his part, President of the Tanzanian Football Association Karia Wallace disavowed Amrouchs’s accusations in previous statements, and stressed that his country respects Morocco and the efforts made by the Football Federation to develop the game on the African continent.

This is due to his controversial remarks made against the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF) in a televised interview the day before the Morocco-Tanzania AFCON match.

Ouest-France: Mohammed VI Academy behind Morocco's football success,Monday 22 January 2024 - 21:09,sports,"In a journey spanning almost fifteen years since its inception, the Mohammed VI Football Academy has elevated Morocco to new heights on the global football stage, according to a report by Ouest-France on Wednesday.
Established in 2009 and situated in Salé, near the capital Rabat, the academy has become a breeding ground for Moroccan talent, boasting state-of-the-art facilities that rival those of the world’s top football clubs, as highlighted by the French media.
The academy, with its modern and avant-garde approach, offers a diverse range of playing surfaces, including grass, synthetic, indoor, and even beach soccer fields within its expansive 18-hectare complex.




Ouest-France notes that the academy’s facilities are on par with, if not superior to, those of European football powerhouses.
Beyond its focus on football development, the Mohammed VI Academy takes a comprehensive approach by providing education to its young talents. Two dormitories and ten classrooms supplement the football training, reflecting a commitment to nurturing well-rounded individuals.
Nasser Larguet, the inaugural director of the academy, emphasized the significance of families entrusting their children to an institution that, despite its nascent stages, displayed promising signs not only in football but also in overall personal development.
The fruits of the academy’s labor are now ripening, with one of the most significant achievements being Morocco’s presence in the semi-final of the 2022 World Cup.
Ouest-France points out that among the 23 Moroccan heroes, four honed their skills at the Mohammed VI Academy, including three who secured starting positions—Azzedine Ounahi, Reda Tagnaouti, Youssef En-Nesyri, and Nayef Aguerd.
Not only has the academy contributed to the success of local players, but it has also played a pivotal role in attracting members of the Moroccan diaspora to represent their homeland.
The likes of Achraf Hakimi, Hakim Ziyech, Sofyan Amrabat, Noussair Mazraoui, Sofiane Boufal, and Amine Harit have all chosen to play for the Lions of the Atlas, thanks to the academy’s influence, as reported by Nasser Larguet.
Larguet notes a significant turning point where the academy showcased the growing potential of Moroccan football. The allure of representing Morocco has led the best Moroccan players born in Europe to eagerly join the national teams, creating a domino effect of talent funneling back to the country.
In a recent trend, promising players of Moroccan origin have opted for their country of origin over their birthplaces. Examples include Oussama El Azzouzi, born in the Netherlands, and Ilias Akhomach, born in Spain.
While the spotlight is currently on Morocco’s impressive journey to the World Cup semi-final in Qatar, Ouest-France highlights that this accomplishment is just one among many recent successes for the country. The U17 team’s historic qualification for the World Cup and the U23 team’s already secured spot in the Olympic Games underscore Morocco’s rising prominence on the international stage.
Former Technical Director of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation emphasizes, “We have results on the world stage. It pushes players to choose Morocco. Today, Morocco presents a very beautiful showcase,” attributing this success to the foundation laid by the Mohammed VI Football Academy.",https://en.hespress.com/78309-ouest-france-mohammed-vi-academy-behind-moroccos-football-success.html,https://e1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Academie-Mohammed-VI-de-football.jpg
